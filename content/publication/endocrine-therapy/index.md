abstract: Endocrine therapy dramatically lowers recurrence risk for breast cancer survivors, yet its strict daily regimen is difficult to maintain. We present a multimodal sensing study that combines smartphone and wearable context, ecological momentary assessments, and patient-reported outcomes to characterize adherence behaviors and develop predictive models that surface moments of risk for just-in-time intervention.
summary: Multimodal sensing and modeling pipeline that predicts endocrine therapy adherence lapses for breast cancer survivors to guide timely interventions.

We capture longitudinal multimodal streams from breast cancer survivors, fuse them with adherence diaries, and train interpretable temporal models that flag non-adherence risk windows. The results highlight psychosocial and behavioral indicators that precede missed doses and point toward personalized digital health interventions.
