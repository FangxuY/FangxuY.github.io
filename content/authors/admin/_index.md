I am currently a Ph.D. student of Systems Engineering at University of Virginia, under the supervision of Professor [Laura E Barnes](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/laura-barnes-0). Before that I got my Master degree in Information Technology from School of Engineering, HKUST, where I did my independent project about indoor localization under Professor [Shueng-Han Gary Chan](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~gchan/) 's supervision. Previously I obtained my Bachelor degree from School of Infomatics, Xiamen University, where I have spent wonderful times as a research assistant with Associate Professor [Longbiao Chen](https://longbiao.crowdsensing.cn/).
